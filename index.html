        <p>My name is Philip Ziolkowski and I am 25 years old. I am a Bay Area native and have lived here all my life. 
          I graduated from Sonoma State University in 2020 with a bachelors degree in Business Administration. I am currently taking part in a coding bootcamp at Flatiron School.
          I have decided to pursue Software Engineering because it is something that has always piqued my interest. I am learning full stack web developement.
          My goal is to one day build an application that will change the world and help everyone around the world and improve the quality of life.
